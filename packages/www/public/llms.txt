# Synatra

> AI agent platform with human-in-the-loop approval workflows. Build, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents that execute tasks, call user-defined tools, and connect to external resources with configurable approval workflows.

Synatra enables teams to build AI agents that can:
- Execute tasks using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Call user-defined tools with configurable approval workflows
- Connect to external resources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Stripe, GitHub, Intercom)
- Generate on-demand UI widgets (forms, tables, charts) for user interaction
- Respond to triggers (cron schedules, webhooks, app events)
- Maintain persistent conversation threads with approval gates

## Key Features

- Human-in-the-Loop: Configurable approval workflows before agents execute sensitive actions
- On-Demand UI: Agents generate forms, tables, charts, and confirmations as needed
- Secure Sandbox: User code runs in isolated VMs with memory limits and network isolation
- Durable Execution: Temporal-based orchestration with automatic state recovery
- Proactive Triggers: Cron schedules, webhooks, and app events to start agent workflows
- Multi-Tenant: Organizations, role-based access control, and environment separation
