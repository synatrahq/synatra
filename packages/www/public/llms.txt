# Synatra

> The AI workspace where you collaborate with AI agents like colleagues. They handle the work, generate the UI, and ask when they need you.

Synatra is a platform for human-AI collaboration. Instead of building and maintaining internal tools, you chat with AI agents that:

- Execute tasks using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Call user-defined tools with configurable approval workflows
- Connect to external resources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, REST API, Stripe, GitHub)
- Generate outputs (tables, charts) and request input (forms, confirmations)
- Respond to triggers (cron schedules, webhooks, app events)
- Maintain persistent conversation threads with approval gates

## Key Features

- Human-in-the-Loop: Configurable approval workflows before agents execute sensitive actions
- On-Demand UI: Agents generate tables, charts, forms, and confirmations as needed
- Secure Sandbox: Tool code runs in isolated VMs with memory limits
- Durable Execution: Temporal-based orchestration with automatic state recovery
- Proactive Triggers: Cron schedules, webhooks, and app events to start workflows
