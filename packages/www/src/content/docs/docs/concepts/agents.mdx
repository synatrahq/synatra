Agents are the core execution units in Synatra. Each agent is an AI executor with versioned configurations.

## Overview

An agent consists of:

- **Working copy** - Draft state for iterating on configurations
- **Releases** - Published, immutable versions with semantic versioning
- **Model configuration** - Provider, temperature, system prompt
- **Assigned tools** - Functions the agent can call

## Creating an agent

1. Navigate to **Agents** in the Console
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Configure the model settings
4. Add tools as needed
5. Write a system prompt

## Model configuration

Synatra supports multiple LLM providers:

| Provider  | Models                      | Special Features         |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| OpenAI    | GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo         | Reasoning effort control |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4 | Extended thinking        |
| Google    | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2    | Thinking config          |

## Releases

When you're ready to deploy an agent:

1. Review the working copy configuration
2. Click **Create Release**
3. The release becomes the active version

Releases are immutable and use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). To make changes, update the working copy and create a new release.

## Outputs

Agents can generate structured outputs displayed to users:

| Output Type | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Table       | Sortable data tables      |
| Chart       | Line, bar, and pie charts |
| Markdown    | Formatted text content    |
| Key-Value   | Display structured data   |

## Human requests

Agents can pause execution and request user input:

| Request Type | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Form         | Input forms with JSON Schema validation       |
| Select Rows  | Table with row selection (single or multiple) |
| Confirm      | Simple approve/reject dialogs                 |
| Approval     | Tool call approval with action details        |
| Question     | Multiple choice questions with options        |

Human requests can wait for user input before the agent continues, allowing for interactive approval flows and data collection.
