description: Organizational structure for conversations in Synatra.
---

The Inbox is where you monitor and manage all conversations. It contains Channels, which group related Threads.

## Inbox

The Inbox is the main view for monitoring active conversations across your organization. It shows all Threads you have access to, with filtering and real-time status updates.

Features:

- Filter by status (running, waiting for input, completed, failed)
- Filter by agent or channel
- Archive completed threads
- Real-time status updates

## Channel

A Channel groups related Threads, similar to Slack channels. Use channels to organize work by team, project, or topic.

### Channel Features

- **Name and description**: Identify the channel's purpose
- **Icon and color**: Visual distinction in the sidebar
- **Default channel**: Every organization has one that cannot be deleted
- **Archiving**: Hide inactive channels without deleting

### Channel Membership

Channels support role-based access:

| Role   | Permissions                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Owner  | Full control over the channel       |
| Member | Can view and participate in threads |

Organization owners and admins automatically have access to all channels.

### Assigned Agents

Each channel can have specific agents assigned. Only assigned agents can start new threads in that channel, allowing different teams to use different agent sets.

## Thread

A Thread is a conversation session between users and agents. Each thread has a subject, belongs to a channel, and contains messages, runs, and outputs.

### Thread Status

| Status            | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Running           | Agent is actively processing          |
| Waiting for input | Agent needs user approval or response |
| Completed         | Conversation finished successfully    |
| Failed            | An error occurred                     |
| Cancelled         | User cancelled the conversation       |
| Rejected          | A required approval was rejected      |
| Skipped           | Thread was skipped by a prompt script |

### Thread Lifecycle

└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Thread Contents

**Messages**
The conversation history:

- User messages
- Agent responses
- Tool calls and results

**Runs**
Execution records for each agent invocation. A thread can have multiple runs when:

- The user sends a follow-up message
- The thread resumes after approval
- Subagents are delegated tasks

**Output Items**
Structured outputs from the agent:

- Tables
- Charts
- Markdown content
- Key-value displays

**Human Requests**
Pending requests for user input:

- Approval requests for sensitive actions
- Form submissions
- Confirmation dialogs

### Starting a Thread

Threads can be started in three ways:

1. **User-initiated**: A user starts a conversation in a channel
2. **Trigger-initiated**: A trigger (schedule, webhook, app event) starts automatically
3. **Prompt-initiated**: A user selects a reusable prompt with input parameters

### Replying to a Thread

Users can reply to threads that are:

- Completed (thread resumes with a new run)
- Rejected (can be restarted after rejection)
- Failed (can be retried)
- Waiting for input (reply continues the conversation)

Threads that are currently running cannot receive replies until the current run completes.

### Playground

Playground threads are isolated test sessions for agent development. Each user has their own playground per agent.

## Access Control

Access to threads is determined by channel membership:

1. Organization owners and admins can access all channels
2. Channel members can access threads in their channels
3. Users can always access threads they created
4. Default channels are accessible to all organization members
