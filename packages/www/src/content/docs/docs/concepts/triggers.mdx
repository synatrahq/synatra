description: Automated workflow initiators for starting agent threads.
---

Triggers allow agents to start workflows automatically based on external events. They connect external systems to your agents without requiring manual intervention.

## Overview

A Trigger defines:

- **When** to start a thread (schedule, webhook, or app event)
- **What agent** handles the thread
- **Which channel** the thread appears in
- **What prompt** to send to the agent

## Trigger Types

| Type      | Description                        | Use Case                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Schedule  | Cron-based recurring execution     | Daily reports, periodic cleanup     |
| Webhook   | HTTP endpoint for external systems | Payment events, CI/CD notifications |
| App Event | Events from connected apps         | GitHub issues, Intercom messages    |

## Prompt Modes

Triggers support three modes for generating the initial prompt:

### Template Mode

Use `{{ path.to.value }}` syntax to inject payload data into a static template:

```
A new issue was created: {{ payload.issue.title }}
Repository: {{ payload.repository.name }}
Author: {{ payload.issue.user.login }}
```

Objects are automatically converted to JSON strings.

### Script Mode

Execute JavaScript to dynamically generate the prompt or skip the thread:

```javascript
const { payload, context } = params

if (payload.action === "closed") {
  return { action: "skip", reason: "Ignoring closed issues" }
}

const prompt = `
New issue #${payload.issue.number}: ${payload.issue.title}

${payload.issue.body}
`

return { action: "run", prompt }
```

Scripts can access resources via `context.resources` and must return either:

- `{ action: "run", prompt: string }` - Start the thread with this prompt
- `{ action: "skip", reason?: string }` - Skip this trigger execution

### Prompt Mode

Reference a reusable Prompt resource instead of inline content.

## Schedule Triggers

Schedule triggers use cron expressions:

| Expression     | Description          |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| `0 9 * * *`    | Every day at 9:00 AM |
| `0 */2 * * *`  | Every 2 hours        |
| `0 9 * * 1`    | Every Monday at 9 AM |
| `0 0 1 * *`    | First of each month  |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes     |

The timezone is configurable per-trigger.

## Webhook Triggers

Webhook triggers provide an HTTP endpoint:

```
POST https://api.synatra.dev/webhooks/{webhook-id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event": "payment_failed",
  "customer_id": "cus_123",
  "amount": 9900
}
```

The entire request body is available as `payload` in templates and scripts.

### Webhook Security

Webhooks can be secured with:

- Secret token validation (custom header)
- IP allowlisting
- Request signature verification

## App Event Triggers

App event triggers respond to events from connected resources:

| App      | Events                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub   | issue.opened, issue.closed, pull_request.opened, pull_request.merged, push   |
| Stripe   | payment_intent.failed, customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed |
| Intercom | conversation.created, conversation.user.replied                              |

The event payload structure matches the respective app's webhook format.

## Version Modes

Triggers support two version modes for the target agent:

| Mode    | Behavior                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Current | Always use the latest agent release      |
| Fixed   | Lock to a specific agent release version |

Use fixed mode for production stability when you don't want agent changes to immediately affect automated workflows.

## Trigger Releases

Like agents and prompts, triggers have versioned releases:

- **Working copy**: Draft configuration for testing
- **Releases**: Published, immutable versions with semantic versioning

Each release can target a different environment, allowing you to:

1. Test triggers against staging
2. Deploy to production when ready

## Environment Binding

Trigger releases are bound to specific environments:

```
Trigger "daily-report"
├── Release 1.0.0 → Production
├── Release 1.1.0 → Staging
└── Working Copy → (any environment for testing)
```

## Debug Mode

Triggers can be fired in debug mode for testing:

- Creates a thread marked for debugging
- Appears in the normal thread list with a debug indicator
- Useful for testing prompt templates and scripts

## Payload Variables

The following variables are available in templates and scripts:

| Variable          | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `payload`         | The incoming event data                     |
| `payload.subject` | Special: If present, used as thread subject |

## Best Practices

1. **Use scripts for complex logic**: Scripts can skip events, transform data, and generate dynamic prompts
2. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Configure agent timeouts based on expected task duration
3. **Monitor thread status**: Set up alerts for failed trigger executions
4. **Use fixed versions in production**: Prevent unexpected behavior from agent changes
5. **Test with debug mode**: Verify trigger behavior before enabling in production
