Triggers allow agents to start workflows automatically based on external events.

## Overview

Synatra supports three trigger types:

| Trigger Type | Description                        | Example                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Schedule     | Cron-based recurring execution     | Every day at 9:00 AM          |
| Webhook      | HTTP endpoint for external systems | Stripe payment failed webhook |
| App Event    | Events from connected apps         | GitHub issue created          |

## Creating a Trigger

1. Navigate to **Triggers** in the Console
2. Click **New Trigger**
3. Select the trigger type
4. Configure the trigger settings
5. Assign an agent and initial prompt

## Schedule Triggers

Schedule triggers use cron expressions to run agents on a recurring schedule:

| Example       | Description          |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| `0 9 * * *`   | Every day at 9:00 AM |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours        |
| `0 9 * * 1`   | Every Monday at 9 AM |
| `0 0 1 * *`   | First of each month  |

## Webhook Triggers

Webhook triggers provide an HTTP endpoint that external systems can call:

- Each trigger gets a unique URL
- Supports POST requests with JSON payload
- Payload data is available in the agent's prompt

## App Event Triggers

App event triggers respond to events from connected resources:

- **GitHub**: Issue created, PR opened, comment added
- **Stripe**: Payment failed, subscription cancelled
- **Intercom**: Conversation created, message received

## Trigger Payload

Triggers can inject dynamic data into the agent's initial prompt using template syntax:

```
A new issue was created: {{ payload.issue.title }}
Repository: {{ payload.repository.name }}
Author: {{ payload.issue.user.login }}
```

The template uses simple property access with `{{ path.to.value }}` syntax. Objects are automatically converted to JSON strings.

## Version Modes

Triggers support two version modes:

- **Current**: Always use the latest agent release. Changes to the agent are immediately reflected.
- **Fixed**: Lock to a specific agent release version. Useful for production stability.
