description: Deployment contexts for resource isolation.

Environments provide isolated deployment contexts within an organization. Use them to separate production workloads from testing.

## Default Environments

Every organization starts with two protected environments:

| Environment | Purpose                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Production  | Live workloads         |
| Staging     | Testing and validation |

Protected environments cannot be deleted.

## Resource Isolation

Each resource can have different configurations per environment. For example, a PostgreSQL resource might connect to different databases:

- **Production**: `prod-db.example.com`
- **Staging**: `staging-db.example.com`

This ensures production threads never accidentally access staging databases, and vice versa.

## How Environments Work

**Threads** are bound to an environment at creation. The environment determines which resource configurations are used during execution.

**Triggers** are activated per environment. You can have a trigger active in staging for testing while keeping it disabled in production.

**Playground** lets you select an environment when testing agent configurations.
