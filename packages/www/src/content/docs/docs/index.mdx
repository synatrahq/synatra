import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Synatra is the AI workspace where you collaborate with AI agents like colleagues. They handle the work, generate the UI, and ask when they need you.

## What is Synatra?

Synatra is the next-generation workspace for human-AI collaboration. Instead of building and maintaining internal tools, you chat with AI agents that:

- Execute tasks using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Call user-defined tools with configurable approval workflows
- Connect to external resources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Stripe, GitHub, Intercom)
- Generate on-demand UI widgets (forms, tables, charts) for user interaction
- Respond to triggers (cron schedules, webhooks, app events)
- Maintain persistent conversation threads with approval gates
